    async def main():
        feeder = FeederDevice("E6:C0:07:09:A3:D3")
        await feeder.connect()

        # Manual feed with 2 portions
        await feeder.feed(portions=2)

        # Set schedule: 8:00 AM every day, 1 portion
        await feeder.set_schedule([
            FeedSchedule(
                weekdays=Weekday.ALL_DAYS,
                time="08:00",
                portions=1,
                enabled=True,
            )
        ])

        # Toggle child lock
        await feeder.set_child_lock(False)  # Unlock

        # Toggle sound
        await feeder.set_sound(True)  # Enable

        await feeder.disconnect()
